# Space Tourism Website

I made this website with four pages based on figma files of [Space tourism website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3). All the pages are responsive for mobile and tablet.

Users in this website are able to:

-   View different pages depending on their device screen size
-   See some nice hover effects on menu items and links
-   Toggle between tabs and see new images and information like a slideshow in Destination, Crew and Technology pages

## Built with

-   React
-   React Router
-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

## What I learned

For the first time I learned how to use figma. Using figma is really nice and simple.
I learned some tips using SCSS and also I found how useful is `flex-direction`:

```css
flex-direction: column-reverse;
```

In making nice responsive layouts.

I found that we have `onAnimationEnd` in React and I made beautiful fading effect for changing information and images in pages without any external library.

I made menu icons for mobile with pure css by using pseudo elemetns in Header.scss file so for showing two icons There is no need for any external library.
